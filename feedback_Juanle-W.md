commit message for thingsIlike.txt: 
change from "move" to "things I like and Alex like"

Practical5:
variables.py: for python2, it allows to use "print" without parentheses, so I did not change it.
fibonacci.py: change the position of "print(c)" by moving it into the for loop so that all first 13 values can be shown instead of just showing the last value.
mysterycode.py: change "print a random integer that is smaller than 51 but is bigger than 0" to "print the first got random integer that is smaller than 51 but is bigger than 0"
r_rate.py: change "print str(n)" to "print(str(n))"

Practical6(the folder name is "0028"):
coronavirus_rates.py: 
1. add "print(cases)" to display frequency table that matches the input when the input table is changed
2. add "plt.title('coronavirus rates for 5 countries')" to give the pie chart a title
list_manipulation.py: 
add "average_exon_lengths=list(average_exon_lengths)
average=sorted(average_exon_lengths)
print(average)"
to sort list of average exon length numerically
